# hero-editor-backend

To understand this project, a previous one has to be set on the table: Angular2 Hero Editor tutorial.

https://angular.io/guide/quickstart

That is the quick start example that Angular2 proposes to understand the fundamentals of the framework. The resulting project is a visual CRUD module of heroes with just an ID and a name as the main Hero object.

As it's explained in the tutorial, HTTP communication is simulated using browser local data storage and leaves for developer imagination how that would be with a real Rest API server.

What I do in this Hero Editor backend project is to implement the Rest API that the Angular2 web client from the tutorial consumes. For persistence purposes, I have installed a local Couchbase cluster.

More explanations to come.
